            <p><span>You may be wondering what it is about Krill that makes them worth protecting from the collective horrid maw of whales worldwide. <br> Here are but a few out of the countless reasons to fight back against the Cetacea menace:</span></p>

                <li><span>At least 10,000 innocent krill are slaughtered by whales every month</span></li>
                <li><span>Krill have big, cute eyes</span></li>

                <li>We hold year long <s>hunting parties</s> conservation trips to reduce the impact whales have on krill population.</li>
                <li>We are constantly innovating to create new specialised equiptement to help conservation efforts.</li>
                <li>We have several <s>whale bait</s> krill conservation sancturies set up across the world</li>

            <h3 id="indquote">"He's not a whale, he's the devil himself" - Capt Ahab</h3>
            <p>Whales are the no.1 predator for krill in the wild, some species of whale exclusively <br> feed on them and kill billions of krill over their lifetime. We specialise in reducing <br> the whale population in order to lessen the impact that they have on the krill population. <br>Here are but a few reasons this is absolutely nessisary:</p>
            <ul id = "indlist">
                <li>Blue whales exclusively feed on krill, that's the animal equivilent of genocide!</li>
                <li>Blue whales are on average the size of three busses, thats just kind of too big</li>
                <li>They make weird noises</li>
                <li>For a single blue whale to be fed for 1 day, millions of krill must die, the loss of life is too great</li>
            </ul>
